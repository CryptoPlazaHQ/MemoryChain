### 2025-11-20: CredentiaLit Use Cases Content Generation Complete

*   **Description:** Completed the extensive content generation for all four Pillars of CredentiaLit Use Cases documentation, strictly adhering to the "Master Use Case Index" and "Agent Coordination Protocol." This included creating dozens of hyper-detailed markdown files within `CredentiaLit/Use_Cases/` for Education & Knowledge Management, Community & Platform Engagement, Workflow Automation, and Data Monetization & Access Control. Also updated `CredentiaLit/Sinopsis/index.md` to link to these new pillar structures.
*   **Key Result:** The CredentiaLit SDK/App now has comprehensive, hyper-detailed use case documentation, fully aligned with the project's institutional focus and brand voice.
