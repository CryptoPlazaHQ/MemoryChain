# PRD: Credentialing Function SDK

This directory contains the Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for the **"Credentialing Function SDK"**.

This SDK is the first major development milestone for the MemoryChain ecosystem. It will be built in a separate repository, `https://github.com/CryptoPlazaHQ/CredentiaLit-Protocol`, as a modular and reusable component for authorization, verifiable credential issuance, and identity management using Lit Protocol.

The documents in this folder will define the features, user stories, technical requirements, and UI/UX flows for the SDK and its accompanying dashboard.
