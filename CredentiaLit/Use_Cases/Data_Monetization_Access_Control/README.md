This folder illustrates how the **CredentiaLit SDK/App** unlocks novel models for data monetization and secure access control, particularly for knowledge creators, researchers, and institutions with valuable digital assets. It addresses challenges related to transparent value exchange, dynamic licensing, and protecting intellectual property.

## Use Cases within this Category:

*   **Credential-Gated Data Access:** Issuing Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that grant access to specific datasets, premium research, or exclusive educational content. Access conditions can be tied to token ownership, payment, or other verifiable criteria.
*   **Dynamic Pricing & Licensing:** Using smart contracts and VCs to represent data licenses, allowing for flexible pricing models and automated royalty distribution directly to knowledge creators.
*   **Verifiable Usage Tracking:** Credentials can also track verifiable data usage, enabling more sophisticated licensing models, audit trails, and ensuring compliance for sensitive information.
*   **Monetization of Automated Services:** Combining with workflow automation (N8N) to offer credential-gated access to specialized data processing or analytics services, verifiable by payment in `$TRUTH` tokens.
