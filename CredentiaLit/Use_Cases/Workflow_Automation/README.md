# Workflow Automation Use Cases: CredentiaLit SDK/App with N8N Integration

---

> "Automation without verifiable authorization is a risk. CredentiaLit turns your N8N workflows into trustless, auditable engines of efficiency."
> — _CredentiaLit Automation Philosophy_

This folder highlights how the **CredentiaLit SDK/App**, particularly through its **specialized N8N nodes**, revolutionizes workflow automation by embedding verifiable, credential-based authorization. It directly addresses the security and auditability challenges of automated processes, making N8N workflows robust, transparent, and trustworthy.

## Use Cases within this Category:

*   **Verifiable Agent/Role Authorization:** Authenticating and authorizing N8N workflows or individual automated agents to perform specific actions based on verifiable roles or permissions.
*   **Secure Data Access for Automation:** Governing N8N access to sensitive institutional data or APIs using VCs, ensuring only authorized automated processes interact.
*   **Automated Credential Issuance/Verification:** Triggering the issuance or verification of credentials within N8N workflows, e.g., issuing a "Course Completed VC" upon an LMS event.
*   **Dynamic Workflow Control:** Enabling N8N workflow branches to execute only if specific verifiable conditions (e.g., user holds a "Premium Tier VC") are met.
