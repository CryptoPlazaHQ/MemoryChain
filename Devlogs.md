# MemoryChain Devlogs

---

This document serves as a chronological record of key development decisions, technical challenges, and significant progress milestones for the MemoryChain project. It is maintained to provide transparency, facilitate asynchronous communication, and serve as an institutional memory for the development team and stakeholders.

## Log Entries:

### 2025-11-18: Agentic Framework Documentation Completion (Post-Rectification)

*   **Summary:** Successfully re-created and verified the hyper-detailed documentation for the entire `02_Agents` folder, including `00_Framework_Overview.md`, `init.md`, and all departmental `README.md` and individual agent profiles (`Stylr`, `Testr`, `Docu`, `Secur`, `Orchestrator` for QA; `Ingestr`, `MetaRich`, `Cureatr`, `Discovr` for Content Management; `Plannr`, `Coordin8`, `Reportr`, `Riskr` for Project Management; `Gameifir`, `Tokenomix`, `Connectr` for Ecosystem Engagement).
*   **Decisions:** Confirmed full re-establishment of the agentic framework blueprint.
*   **Challenges:** Rectifying previous `git` state divergence and re-generating lost documentation content.
*   **Next Steps:** Verify other documentation (`Logic`, `QMS`, `01_MVP`, `prd`), re-add original files, ensure `.gitignore` is correct, and perform a consolidated commit and force push.

### 2025-11-18: Quality Management System Documentation Completion

*   **Summary:** Completed hyper-detailed documentation for the `00_Project_Framework/Quality_Management_System/README.md`, outlining the Agentic QMS Protocol.
*   **Decisions:** Established a vision for an autonomous, agent-driven QMS as a potential product.
*   **Key Agents:** Defined roles for `Stylr`, `Testr`, `Docu`, `Secur`, and `Orchestrator` within QA.

### 2025-11-18: MVP Documentation Completion

*   **Summary:** Completed hyper-detailed documentation for the `01_MVP` folder, including `02_Feature_Breakdown.md`, `03_Acceptance_Criteria.md`, and `04_Technical_Considerations.md`.
*   **Decisions:** Provided granular detail for MVP features, acceptance criteria, and technical specifics.

### 2025-11-18: Logic Folder Documentation Completion

*   **Summary:** Completed hyper-detailed documentation for the `00_Project_Framework/Logic` folder, including `1.Concept/README.md`, `2.Project_MockUp/README.md`, `3.Technical_Strategy/README.md`, `4.Tokenomics/README.md`, and `5.Gamification_Strategy/README.md`.
*   **Decisions:** Established core conceptual frameworks, design principles, technical strategies, tokenomics, and gamification models.

### 2025-11-18: Initial Project Setup & Doc Alignment

*   **Summary:** Initialized Git repository, configured remote, and began aligning project documentation with the new strategic focus on the "Credentialing Function SDK" leveraging Lit Protocol.
*   **Changes:**
    *   `00_Project_Framework/01_Project_Definition/01_Vision_and_Scope.md`: Updated "Verifiable Credentials" to reference Lit Protocol and Credentialing SDK.
    *   `00_Project_Framework/01_Project_Definition/02_Project_Charter.md`: Replaced "POK Technology" with "Lit Protocol" and updated goals/scope to include Credentialing SDK.
    *   `00_Project_Framework/01_Project_Definition/03_Technology_Stack.md`: Clarified "Authentication & Verifiable Credentials" to explicitly mention the separate Credentialing Function SDK.
    *   `00_Project_Framework/01_Project_Definition/04_Technical_Architecture_Summary.md`: Updated diagram and text to reflect the Credentialing Function SDK as an external repository.
    *   `01_MVP/00_MVP_Definition.md`: Updated "Key Features" and "Technology Stack" to reflect Credentialing Function SDK and Lit Protocol.
    *   `01_MVP/01_User_Stories.md`: Updated user stories to include Credentialing Function SDK and a "Developer" persona.
    *   `prd/` folder created with `README.md`, `Credential_SDK_Requirements.md`, `Dashboard_UI_UX.md`.
*   **Decisions:** Formalized the strategic shift towards Lit Protocol for credentialing and established the `prd` folder for the SDK.
*   **Challenges:** Initial Git push issues due to unfamiliarity with remote state.
*   **Next Steps:** Proceed with detailed documentation of core project pillars.

### 2025-11-15: Project Initialization

*   **Summary:** Repository created and initial files ingested.
*   **Decisions:** Established project structure and core markdown documentation.
*   **Next Steps:** Define project vision, scope, and technical roadmap.
