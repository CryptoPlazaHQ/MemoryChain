the Roadmap in Project definition which is the cornerstone will consider in this edition that first to implement is the Credentialling Function SDK as Authorization method with the sdk it would be also very professional to create a great dashboard interdace that can be scalable for further functions like creating the credentially with register and aouth open source also thinking in an use case to start the mvp for LMS like moodle, remember POK as example, so this feature will be manage in a different repo (https://github.com/CryptoPlazaHQ/CredentiaLit-Protocol) as a component that could be isolated and aplicated for any other projects (Maybe a Lit Grant who Knows)

This part is very important because displays our values on transforming education and providing tools (the presentation of this project of credentials can be manage with great tactic to call attention on ONGs or other instittions in the knowledge management reserach and development with the great hook of implied monetization with this kind of systems -real use cases not too long to implement)
