## Core Pillars of CryptoPlaza Development

CryptoPlaza's development strategy is built upon these foundational pillars:

1.  **SDKs (Software Development Kits):**
    *   **Objective:** To lower the barrier to entry for developers, enabling easy integration with Filecoin, Lit Protocol, and other decentralized services.
    *   **Focus:** Creating modular, well-documented, and open-source SDKs that abstract away complexity, allowing developers to focus on innovation.
    *   **Example:** MemoryChain's Lit Protocol integration SDKs for authentication and privacy-preserving proofs.

2.  **Dapps (Decentralized Applications):**
    *   **Objective:** To build compelling, user-friendly applications that showcase the power and utility of decentralized technologies.
    *   **Focus:** Developing high-impact use cases that solve real-world problems and demonstrate the benefits of decentralization.
    *   **Example:** The MemoryChain project, serving as a flagship dApp for verifiable historical memory and data interaction.

3.  **Frameworks:**
    *   **Objective:** To provide robust, scalable, and interoperable frameworks that accelerate the development of decentralized solutions.
    *   **Focus:** Building foundational layers that support agentic systems, Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, and advanced AI/ML capabilities.
    *   **Example:** The MCP development within MemoryChain, enabling intelligent LLM interaction with IPFS data.

## Strategic Alignment: Filecoin & Lit Protocol

CryptoPlaza is strategically aligned with the goals of the Filecoin Foundation and Lit Protocol, aiming to:

*   **Filecoin Network:** Increase visibility and drive high-impact use cases for decentralized storage. We will develop tools and applications that make it easier to store, retrieve, and verify data on Filecoin, promoting its resilience and permanence.
*   **Lit Protocol:** Enhance the utility and adoption of Lit Protocol's decentralized key management, access control, and programmable cryptography. We will build SDKs and integrations that leverage Lit for secure authentication, verifiable credentials, and privacy-preserving proofs.

## CryptoPlaza Roadmap: Developer & Technical Grants Focus

The CryptoPlaza roadmap is driven by a focus on developer and technical grants, viewing these as opportunities to fund core stack development, build open-source resources, and organically grow our portfolio.

*   **Grant-Driven Development:** Each grant opportunity is assessed for its alignment with our core pillars and its potential to accelerate the development of critical infrastructure.
*   **Open Source Contribution:** All grant-funded development will prioritize open-source releases, contributing valuable SDKs, Dapps, and frameworks back to the community.
*   **Brand Awareness & Portfolio Building:** Successfully executed grants will not only provide funding but also serve as tangible proof points of our capabilities, building a strong reputation and portfolio within the Web3 ecosystem.
