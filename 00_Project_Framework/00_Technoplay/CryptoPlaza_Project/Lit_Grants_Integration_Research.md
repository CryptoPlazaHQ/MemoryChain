## User Journeys: Navigating MemoryChain with Lit Protocol

MemoryChain, powered by Lit Protocol, offers distinct and secure user journeys for various stakeholders, ensuring verifiable interactions and fostering a trusted ecosystem.

### 1. The Institutional Researcher's Onboarding & Data Ingestion Journey

**Scenario:** Dr. Anya Sharma, a senior historian at a national government archive, is tasked with digitizing and ingesting a collection of sensitive historical documents into MemoryChain for long-term preservation and secure access.

**Lit Protocol Role & Workflow:**

1.  **Training & Certification (Lit-backed VC):** Dr. Sharma first enrolls in an online "MemoryChain Data Ingestion Best Practices" course, potentially hosted on an LMS like Moodle. Upon successful completion, a **Lit-backed Verifiable Credential (VC)** is automatically issued to her, certifying her proficiency and adherence to institutional data handling protocols. This VC is stored securely and verifiably, acting as her digital license to operate within MemoryChain.
2.  **Platform Access & Authentication (Lit PKP):** Dr. Sharma accesses the MemoryChain Ingestion Dashboard. Instead of a traditional username/password, she authenticates using her **Lit Programmable Key Pair (PKP)**, which provides a robust, decentralized, and phishing-resistant login mechanism. The system verifies her PKP, confirming her identity and role.
3.  **Data Ingestion Authorization (Lit Actions & Institutional Signature):** When Dr. Sharma prepares to upload a batch of sensitive documents, MemoryChain's workflow requires an additional layer of authorization. A **Lit Action** is triggered, which checks two conditions:
    *   Verification of Dr. Sharma's "MemoryChain Certified User" VC.
    *   A digital signature from her department head, Dr. Ben Carter. Dr. Carter receives a notification and uses his own **Lit PKP** to digitally sign the ingestion request. This signature, secured by Lit's threshold cryptography, acts as an immutable, verifiable approval from the institutional authority.
4.  **Secure Data Ingestion:** Once both conditions are met and verified by the Lit Action, Dr. Sharma is granted final authorization to proceed with the data ingestion. The documents are then processed, IPFS CIDs are generated, and metadata is prepared.
5.  **Fine-Grained Access Control (Lit Actions for Decryption):** After ingestion, access to certain highly sensitive documents within the archive is restricted. **Lit Actions** are configured to control decryption keys. Only researchers holding specific **Lit-backed VCs** (e.g., "Top Secret Clearance for Project Chimera") can decrypt and view these particular documents, ensuring data confidentiality even within the decentralized storage.
