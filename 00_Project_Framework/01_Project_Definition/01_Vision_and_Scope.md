# 01. Vision and Scope: MemoryChain

## 1. Vision

To build the world's most trusted and enduring digital archive, a living testament to human history and achievement, where truth is immutable and accessible to all. We envision a future where every important document, from a birth certificate to a peace treaty, is preserved with absolute integrity and can be verified by anyone, anywhere, instantly.

MemoryChain will be the cornerstone of this future, a decentralized platform that empowers individuals, organizations, and governments to safeguard their most valuable data against censorship, loss, and time itself.

## 2. Scope

The scope of the MemoryChain project is to design, develop, and deploy a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates the ingestion, storage, and verification of digital assets. The platform will be built on a foundation of IPFS, Filecoin, and a compatible blockchain, and will be designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and secure.

### Key Features

*   **Data Ingestion:** A simple and intuitive interface for uploading digital assets, including documents, images, audio, and video.
*   **Metadata Generation:** Automatic and manual metadata generation to enrich the data and make it more discoverable.
*   **Decentralized Storage:** Secure and permanent storage of data on IPFS and Filecoin.
*   **Verifiable Credentials:** Integration with POK Technology to issue OpenBadge 3.0 compliant verifiable credentials for all assets.
*   **NFT-based Access Control:** The use of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to manage access rights and permissions for the data.
*   **Semantic Search:** An advanced search engine that uses AI and LLMs to enable natural language queries and semantic retrieval of information.
*   **Whitelabeling:** The ability for organizations to customize the platform with their own branding and workflows.

### Target Audience

*   **Phase 1:** Historical memory organizations (e.g., CNMH) and educational institutions in Colombia.
*   **Phase 2:** Government agencies, non-profit organizations, and corporations throughout Latin America.
*   **Phase 3:** Global expansion to serve a wide range of industries and use cases.
