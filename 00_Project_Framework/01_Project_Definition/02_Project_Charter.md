# 00. Project Charter: MemoryChain

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** MemoryChain

**Project Manager:** [Your Name/AI Agent Name]

**Project Sponsor:** [Your Name/TechnoPlay]

**Date:** 2025-11-13

**Project Mission:** To create a decentralized, trustworthy, and user-friendly platform for preserving historical memory and verifying credentials, starting with a pilot in Colombia and expanding throughout other countries.

## 2. Project Goals & Objectives

### Goals

*   To develop a robust and scalable platform for the secure and permanent storage of historical documents and other valuable data.
*   To provide a user-friendly interface for data ingestion, metadata generation, and verification.
*   To integrate a robust verifiable credential solution using Lit Protocol.
*   To stablish collaborations with human rights organisations, research and development public and private institutions.
*   To secure funding for the long-term development and expansion of the project.

### Objectives

*   **Phase 1 (Validation):**
    *   Develop a functional mockup of the platform.
    *   Develop the "Credentialing Function SDK" as an authorization method, including a scalable dashboard interface.
    *   Secure a partnership with Lit Protocol.
    *   Successfully run a pilot with 12 historical documents.
*   **Phase 2 (Core Development):**
    *   Develop the full backend and frontend of the platform.
    *   Onboard 144 historical documents.
    *   Issue 12 verifiable credentials using the Credentialing Function SDK.
*   **Phase 3 (Public Launch):**
    *   Go-live with the CNMH (Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica).
    *   Go-live with PBI (Peace Brigades International).
    *   Onboard 2-5 universities.
    *   Begin regional expansion.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

*   Development of the MemoryChain platform, including the frontend, backend, and smart contracts.
