# 00. Project Charter: MemoryChain

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** MemoryChain

**Project Manager:** [Your Name/AI Agent Name]

**Project Sponsor:** [Your Name/TechnoPlay]

**Date:** 2025-11-13

**Project Mission:** To establish MemoryChain as the definitive decentralized platform for **preserving historical memory and ensuring educational integrity**, enabling **verifiable credentials for learners** and robust **knowledge management for institutions**. We begin with pilots in Colombia, focusing on **educational and research sectors**, and expand globally.

## 2. Project Goals & Objectives

### Goals

*   To develop a robust and scalable platform for the secure and permanent storage of critical historical documents and **educational data**.
*   To provide a user-friendly interface for data ingestion, intelligent metadata generation, and **fraud-proof credential verification**.
*   To integrate a robust verifiable credential solution using Lit Protocol, embodied in the **CredentiaLit SDK**, to **empower learners and streamline institutional processes**.
*   To establish collaborations with **educational institutions, research bodies**, human rights organizations, and public/private institutions focused on knowledge management.
*   To secure funding for the long-term development and expansion of the project, emphasizing its **transformative impact on education and verifiable knowledge**.

### Objectives

*   **Phase 1 (Validation):**
    *   Develop a functional mockup of the platform, showcasing **credential issuance for LMS use cases**.
    *   Develop the **CredentiaLit SDK** as the primary authorization and credentialing method, including a scalable dashboard interface.
    *   Secure a partnership with Lit Protocol and **pilot educational institutions**.
    *   Successfully run a pilot with 12 historical documents and **demonstrate verifiable credential issuance for a pilot university course**.
*   **Phase 2 (Core Development):**
    *   Develop the full backend and frontend of the platform, including **enhanced LMS integration capabilities**.
    *   Onboard 144 historical documents and **integrate with 3-5 pilot university programs for credentialing**.
    *   Issue 12 verifiable credentials and **automate credential issuance for 500+ students across pilot programs** using the CredentiaLit SDK.
*   **Phase 3 (Public Launch):**
    *   Go-live with the CNMH (Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica) and **major educational institutions**.
    *   Go-live with PBI (Peace Brigades International) and **at least one prominent LMS provider**.
    *   Onboard **2-5 universities** for full platform integration.
    *   Begin regional expansion, targeting key **educational and research hubs**.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

*   Development of the MemoryChain platform, including the frontend, backend, and smart contracts.
*   Development of the **CredentiaLit SDK** and its accompanying dashboard interface for **verifiable credential issuance and authorization**.
*   Integration with IPFS and Filecoin for decentralized storage of **educational content and institutional archives**.
*   Integration with Lit Protocol for **fraud-proof verifiable credentials and dynamic access control**.
*   Development of a user-friendly onboarding process for **institutional administrators and individual learners**.
*   Creation of documentation for users, developers, and agents, emphasizing **educational pathways and knowledge monetization**.

### Out of Scope

*   Development of a new blockchain protocol.
*   Physical digitization of historical documents.
*   Marketing and sales activities beyond the initial pilot partners, with a strong focus on **educational and institutional outreach**.

## 4. Stakeholders
