# 4. Tokenomics: MemoryChain

This folder will contain all documentation related to the economic model and token design of the MemoryChain ecosystem. It will define the utility, value, and distribution mechanisms of any native tokens or incentive structures within the platform.

## Contents:

*   **Token Utility:** Explanation of the token's purpose within the MemoryChain ecosystem (e.g., governance, staking, payment for services, incentivizing storage providers).
*   **Token Distribution:** Details on how tokens will be allocated and distributed (e.g., initial coin offering, grants, community rewards, mining).
*   **Value Accrual Mechanisms:** How the token's value is designed to grow and be sustained.
*   **Incentive Models:** Design of economic incentives for participants (e.g., data providers, storage providers, curators, developers).
*   **Governance Model:** How token holders will participate in the decentralized governance of the MemoryChain protocol.
*   **Economic Simulations & Modeling:** Analysis of the token's economic behavior under various scenarios.
*   **Legal & Regulatory Considerations:** Assessment of the legal and regulatory landscape for the token.
