# Tokenomics: The Economic Engine of the Living Archive

---

**Disclaimer:** This document outlines a preliminary tokenomic model for the MemoryChain ecosystem. It is intended for strategic planning and discussion. The final model will be subject to further research, economic modeling, legal counsel, and community feedback.

---

## 1. The Utility Token: `$TRUTH`

To power the MemoryChain ecosystem, we propose the introduction of a native utility token, named **TRUTH**. The name itself reflects the core mission of the project: to be a source of verifiable truth.

*   **Token Name:** TRUTH
*   **Ticker:** `$TRUTH`
*   **Type:** An ERC-20 compliant token on a low-cost, high-throughput blockchain (e.g., Polygon, Arbitrum) with potential for multichain expansion.

## 2. Core Utilities of `$TRUTH`

The `$TRUTH` token is not a speculative asset; it is the lifeblood of the MemoryChain economy, designed to facilitate, incentivize, and govern the actions within the ecosystem.

### A. Medium of Exchange & Payments

`$TRUTH` is the primary currency for accessing services on the platform.

*   **Storage & Archiving Fees:** While Filecoin storage deals are paid for in FIL, MemoryChain will charge a small fee in `$TRUTH` to orchestrate and manage these deals. This fee covers the operational costs of the backend services and contributes to the ecosystem treasury.
*   **Premium AI Agent Services:** Basic metadata extraction may be free, but advanced AI agent services (e.g., "Translate this entire archive of documents," "Perform a deep semantic analysis correlating these 1,000 assets") will be paid for in `$TRUTH`.
*   **Marketplace for Data:** In later phases, institutions could use `$TRUTH` to license access to specific curated datasets, creating a new economy for valuable, verified information.

### B. Staking & Security

Staking `$TRUTH` is a mechanism for participants to signal their commitment to the network's health and to earn rewards for their work.

*   **Curator Staking:** To ensure high-quality metadata and prevent spam, users who wish to contribute as "Curators" (verifying metadata, cleaning data) must stake a certain amount of `$TRUTH`. If their work is consistently high-quality (as rated by the community or AI agents), they earn a share of network rewards. If their work is malicious or low-quality, their stake can be "slashed" (partially forfeited).
*   **Storage Provider Bonding:** While Filecoin has its own staking, third-party storage services that wish to be "Certified MemoryChain Providers" might be required to stake `$TRUTH` as a secondary bond, providing an extra layer of assurance to institutions.

### C. Governance

The long-term vision for MemoryChain is a decentralized protocol governed by its community. `$TRUTH` is the key to this governance.

*   **MemoryChain DAO:** A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will be formed to oversee the protocol.
*   **Voting Power:** Holding `$TRUTH` tokens will grant voting rights within the DAO. One token equals one vote. Users can vote on proposals such as:
    *   Protocol upgrades and new feature integrations.
    *   Allocation of treasury funds for ecosystem grants.
    *   Changes to the fee structure or staking parameters.
    *   Onboarding new "certified" institutional partners.
*   **Proposal Submission:** A higher threshold of staked `$TRUTH` will be required to submit new governance proposals, preventing spam while empowering committed stakeholders.

## 3. Token Distribution & Allocation

A total fixed supply of `$TRUTH` tokens will be minted. A potential allocation is as follows:

*   **Ecosystem & Community Rewards (40%):** A large portion dedicated to incentivizing participation. This includes rewards for curator staking, grants for developers building on the platform, and rewards for community bounties (gamification). This allocation will be released gradually over many years.
*   **Core Contributors & Team (20%):** To reward the team for building the protocol. Subject to a multi-year vesting schedule to ensure long-term alignment.
*   **MemoryChain Foundation Treasury (15%):** A treasury managed by the DAO to fund ongoing operations, strategic partnerships, marketing, and legal expenses.
*   **Private & Strategic Sale (15%):** For early backers and strategic partners who provide initial capital and valuable ecosystem connections. Subject to a vesting schedule.
*   **Public Sale / Liquidity (10%):** To ensure sufficient liquidity on decentralized exchanges and allow for public participation.

## 4. Value Accrual & Sustainability

The `$TRUTH` token is designed to capture value as the MemoryChain platform grows.

*   **Fee-Based Value Accrual:** A percentage of all fees collected on the platform (e.g., from archiving fees, premium AI services) will be used in one of two ways, decided by the DAO:
    1.  **Token Burn:** A portion of the fees are permanently removed from circulation ("burned"), creating a deflationary pressure on the token supply.
    2.  **Treasury Accrual:** The fees are sent to the DAO treasury, increasing the collective assets of the community and allowing for further investment in the ecosystem's growth.
*   **Increased Demand:** As more institutions join and more data is archived, the demand for `$TRUTH` to pay for fees and for staking will naturally increase.

This tokenomic model creates a flywheel: platform usage drives demand for `$TRUTH` and generates fees, which in turn fund the DAO and reward community members, who then work to improve the platform and attract more users. It is an economic engine designed for sustainable, decentralized growth.
